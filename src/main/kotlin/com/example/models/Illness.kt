The chance of becoming pregnant is much higher after 4 to 6 months when the baby begins to get other foods in addition to breast milk. Too be sure she will not become pregnant, the mother who is breast feeding should begin some method of birth control when the baby is 3 to 4 months old. The earlier she begins, the surer it is. Before the baby is 6 months old. a method other than birth control pills is better as the pills cause some women to produce less milk.",""),
    Illness(70,"The rhythm method","",""),
    Illness(137,"The mucus method","This is a variation of the rhythm method that is being encouraged by some religious groups. It works fairly well for some people but not for others. In general it cannot be considered very sure way of preventing pregnancy but costs nothing and has no other risks than those that come with the pregnancy itself. Every day, except during her period, the woman should examine the mucus from her vagina. Take a little mucus out of your vagina with a clean finger and try to make it stretch between your thumb and forefinger. As long as the mucus is sticky like paste- not slippery or slimy- you probably cannot become pregnant and can continue to have sexual relations. When the mucus begins to get slippery or slimy, like raw egg or it stretches between your fingers, you may become pregnant. So do not have sex when the mucus is slippery or stretches.",""),

It must be applied no longer than 1 hour before having sex and lest in for at least 6 hours afterward.

    Illness(142,"Withdrawal or pulling out(Coitus interrupts)","Is a method in which a man pulls his penis out of the woman before the sperm comes. This method is perhaps better then none, but is disturbing to the couple and does not always work. Some sperm often leaks out ahead of time and can cause pregnancy.",""),
    Illness(67,"Menstrual Period Problems","Most girls have their first periods or monthly bleeding between the ages of 11 and 16. This means that they are now old enough to become pregnant.. The normal period comes once every 28 days or so, and lasts 3 to 6 days. However this varies a lot in different women. Irregular or painful periods are common in adolescent (teenage) girls. This does not usually mean there is anything wrong. If your menstrual period is painful, There is no need for you to stay in bed. In fact lying quietly can make the pain worse. It often helps to walk around and do light work or exercise or take hot drinks or put your feet in hot water. It may also help to put hot compresses on the belly. Some irregularity in the length of time between periods is normal for certain women, but for others it may be a sign of chronic illness, anemia, malnutrition or possibly an infection or tumor in the womb. If the period does not come when expected could be a sign of pregnancy. If bleeding starts during pregnancy it is almost the beginning of a miscarriage. If the menstrual period lasts more than 6 days, results in heavy bleeding or comes more than once a month seek medical advice. ",""),
   Illness(68,"Menopause","THe menopause or climacteric is the time in a woman's life when the menstrual period stops coming.

During menopause, it is normal for a woman to feel many discomforts- anxiety, distress, hot flashes, pains that travel all over the body, sadness etc After menopause is over many women feel better again. ",""),
    Illness(130,"Difficult Births","It is important to get medical help as soon as possible when here is any serious problem during labor. Many complications may come up, some more serous than others. A.LABOR STOPS OR SLOWS DOWN. or lasts a very long time after being strong or after the water breaks. This has several causes:- 1. The woman may be frightened or upset. This can slow down or even stop contractions. Talk to her. Try tp pressure her. Explain that the birth is slow, but there are no serious problems. Encourage her to change her position often and to drink, eat and urinate. 2. The baby may be in an unusual position. Feel the belly between contractions to see if the baby is sideways. Sometimes the midwife can turn the baby through gentle handling of the woman's belly. Try to work the baby around little by little between contractions until the head is down. But do not use force as this could tear the womb. If the baby can not be turned, try to get the mother to the hospital. 3. If the baby is facing forward rather than backward, you may feel the lumpy arms and legs rather than the rounded back. This is usually no big problem but labour may be longer and cause the woman more back pain. She should change positions often as this may help turn the baby. 4. The baby's head may be too large to fit through the woman's hip bones(pelvis). This is more likely in a woman with very narrow hips or a woman who is very much shorter than her husband.(it is very unlikely in a woman who has given normal birth before). You may feel that the baby does not move down. If you suspect  this problem, try to get the mother to the hospital. WOmen who have very narrow hips or are especially short should have at least their first child in or near a hospital. 5. If the mother has been vomiting or has not been drinking, she may be dehydrated. This can slow down or stop contractions. Have her sip Rehydration drink or other liquids between contractions. B. Breech Delivery- the buttocks comes out first. Sometimes the midwife can tell if the baby is in the breech position by listening to the baby's heartbeat. If the baby's legs come out but not the arms, wash you hands very well, rub them will alcohol(or wear sterile gloves) then slip your fingers inside and push the baby's shoulders toward the back or press his arms against his body. If the head gets stuck, have the mother lie face up. Put your finger in the baby's mouth and push their head towards their chest. At the same time have someone push the baby's head down by pressing on the mother's belly. Have the mother push hard but never pull on the body of a baby. C. PRESENTATION OF THE ARM(hand first)If the baby's hand comes out first, get medical help right away. An operation may be needed to get thr baby out. D. cORD WRAPPED AROUND THE BABY'S NECK so tightly they can not come out all the way. Try to slip the loop of cord from around the baby's neck. If you cannot do this, you may have to clamp or tie and cut the cord. Use boiled blunt-tipped scissors. E. FECES IN THE BABY'S MOUTH AND NOSE. when the waters break, if you they contain the baby's first black stools(meconium), the baby may be in danger. If he breathes any of the feces into his lungs. he may die. A soon as his head is out, tell the mother not to push, but take short rapid breaths. Before the baby starts breathing, take time to suck the feces out of his nose and mouth with a suction bulb, if he starts breathing right away, keep sucking until you get all the feces out. F. TWINS. Giving birth to twins is often difficult and dangerous both for the mother and babies than giving birth to single baby.To be safe the mother should give birth to twins in a hospital. And since with twins labor often begins early, the mother should be within easy reach of a hospital after the seventh month of pregnancy. Signs of twin pregnancy include:- THe belly grows faster and the womb is larger especially in the last months. THe woman gains weight faster than normal or the common problems of pregnancy(morning sickness, backache, varicose veins, piles, swelling and difficult breathing are worse than usual, be sure to check for twins. If you can feel 3 or more large objects (heads and buttocks) in a womb that seems extra large, twins are likely. Sometimes  you can hear 2 different heartbeats(other than the mother's) but this is difficult. During the last months, if the woman rests a lot and is careful to avoid hard work, twins are les likely to be born too early. Twins are often born small and need special care. However, there is no truth in beliefs that twins have strange or magic powers. G.TEARING OF THE BIRTH OPENING. The birth opening must stretch a lot for the baby to come out. Sometimes it tears. Tearing is more likely if it is the mother's first baby. Tearing can usually be prevented if care is taken: The mother should ry to stop pushing when the baby's head is coming out. This gives her birth opening time to stretch. In order not to push, she should pant(take many rapid breaths). When the birth opening is stretching, the midwife can support it with one hand and with the other hand gently keep the head from coming fast. It may also help to put hot compresses against the skin below the birth opening. Start when it begins to stretch. If a tear does happen, someone who knows how should carefully sew it shut after the placenta comes out.   ",""),
    Illness(131,"Care of the newborn baby","The cord . To prevent the freshly cut cord from becoming infected, it should be kept clean and dry. THe drier it is the sooner it will fall off and the navel will heal. For this reason, it is better not to use a belly band or if one is used, to keep it very loose. The Eyes. To protect a newborn baby's eyes from dangerous conjunctivitis, put a drop of 1% silver nitrate, or a little tetracycline eye ointment, in each eye as soon as they are born. This is especially important if either parent has ever had signs of gonorrhea. Keep the baby warm -but not too warm, protect the baby from cold, but also from too much heat. Dress them as warmly as you feel like dressing yourself. Cleanliness: Change the baby's diapers or bedding each time he wets or dirties them. .If the skin gets red, change the diaper more often- or better, leave it off. After the core drops off, bathe the baby daily with mild soap and warm water. If there are flies or mosquito's, cover the baby's crib with mosquito netting or a thin cloth. Persons with open sores, colds, sore throat, tuberculosis, or other infectious illness should not touch or go near the baby. Keep the baby in a clean place away from smoke and dust. Feeding. Breast milk is by far the best food for a baby. Babies who nurse on breast milk are healthier, grow stronger and are less likely to die. Breast milk has a better balance of what the baby needs than does any other milk. Breast milk is clean. When other foods are given, especially by bottle feeding, it is very hard to keep things clean enough tp prevent the baby from getting diarrhea and other sicknesses. The temperature of breast milk is always right. Breast milk has in it antibiotics that protect the baby against certain illnesses such as measles and polio. The mother should give her breast to the baby as soon as they are born. For the first few days for the mother's breast usually produces very little milk, this is normal. Tha baby's sucking will help her produce more milk. A mother whose breast make enough milk should give her baby only breast milk for the first 4 to 6 months. After that she should continue to breast feed the baby but should begin to give them other nourishing foods. To produce more milk, a mother should drink plenty of liquids, eat as well as possible especially milk products and body building foods. Get plenty of sleep and avoid getting tired or upset and nurse her baby more often.    ",""),

    Illness(146,"Bacterial infection in the blood(Septicemia)","Newborn babies cannot fight infections well. Therefore, bacteria that enter the baby's skin or cord at the time of birth often get into the blood and spread through his whole body. Since this takes a day or two, septicemia is most common after the second day of life.

While any of these signs might be caused by something else other than septicemia, but then if the baby has several of these signs at once, septicemia is likely.

Spoon feed breast milk and Rehydration drink if necessary. Try to get medical help.",""),
    Illness(134,"Lumps or Growths in the lower part of the belly","The most common lump is, of course caused by the normal development of a baby. Abnormal lumps or masses may be caused by:- a cyst or watery swelling in one of the ovaries or by a baby that has accidentally begun to develop outside of the womb(ectopic pregnancy ) or cancer. All 3 of these conditions are usually painless or mildly uncomfortable at first and becomes painful later. All require medical attention-usually surgery. If you find any unusual growing lump, seek medical advice.",""),
    Illness(135,"Miscarriage","A miscarriage is the lss of the unborn baby. Miscarriages are most frequent in the first 3 months of pregnancy. Usually the baby is imperfectly formed, and this is nature's way of taking care of the problem. Most women have one or more miscarriages in their lifetime. Many  times, they do not realize that they are having a miscarriage. They may think their period was missed or delayed, and then came back in a strange way, with big blood clots. A woman should learn to know when she is having a miscarriage, because it could be dangerous. A woman who has heavy bleeding after she has missed one or more periods probably is having a miscarriage. A Miscarriage is like birth in that the embryo(the beginning of the baby) and the placenta(after birth) must both come out. Bleeding often continues until both are completely out. If there is heavy bleeding, generally there is no problem. The woman should stay in bed, and the miscarriage should be treated with the same care and precautions as a birth. If there is heavy bleeding or bleeding continues for many days, get medical help. A simple operation may be needed to clean out the womb(dilation and curettage or D and C). Stay in bed until the heavy bleeding stops and for 2 or 3 days after the miscarriage. If fever or other signs of infection develop, treat as for childbirth fever.",""),
    Illness(136,"Cancer of the womb","Sometimes a baby begins to form outside the womb, in one of the tubes that comes from the ovaries.

If you suspect this problem, seek medical advice soon, as dangerous could start any time. Cancer of the uterus(womb), cervix(neck of the womb), or ovaries is most common in women over 40. The first sign may be anemia or unexplained bleeding. Later an uncomfortable or painful lump in the belly may be noticed.",""),
    Illness(143,"Sore Nipples","Sore nipples may develop when the baby bites on the nipple instead of taking the whole thing into his mouth. This is most likely to happen in women who have short nipples. If a woman with short nipples squeezes her nipples several times a day during pregnancy, this will make it easier for her child to suck and she will be less likely to get sore nipples. It is important to keep breastfeeding the baby even though this hurts. First let him suck the side that is least sore. Only stop breast feeding if the nipple oozes a lot of blood or pus. In this case. milk the breast by hand until the nipple heals. When the baby feeds again make sure the whole nipple enters his mouth.",""),

This is most common during the first weeks or months of breast feeding. Part of the breast becomes hot, red, swollen and very painful. Lymph nodes in the armpit are often sore and swollen. A severe abscess sometimes bursts and drains pus. Keep the breast clean. If a sore nipple or painful cracks develop, breast feed the baby for shorter periods, but more often. Also put a little vegetable oil or baby oil on the nipples after each feeding. Let the baby continue to feed from the abscessed breast, or milk it by hand. Whichever is less painful. Use cold water or ice compresses to ease the pain. Also take aspirin. Take an antibiotic as for childbirth fever.","",""),

The woman may notice a lump or the breast may have abnormal dent or dimple- or many tiny pits like the skin of an orange. Often there are large but painless lymph nodes in the armpit. The lump grows slowly. At first it usually does not hurt or get hot. Later it may hurt. Every woman should learn how to examine her own breasts for possible signs of cancer. Once a month. Look at your breasts carefully for any new difference between the two in size or shape. While lying with a pillow or folded blanket under your back, feel your breasts with the flat of your fingers. Press your breast and roll it beneath your finger tips. Start near the nipple and go round the breast and up into the armpit. Then squeeze your nipples and check whether blood or discharge comes out.

If the feet are very swollen and the hands and face also swell, seek medical advice.Low back pain- it can be helped by exercise and taking care to stand and sit with the back straight. Anemia and malnutrition- eat more protein(beans,groundnuts,chicken,milk,cheese,eggs,meat,fish and dark green leafy vegetables. Swollen veins(varicose veins)-Put your feet up often as high as you can.
